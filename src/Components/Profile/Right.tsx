              ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm someone who's currently preparing for a job as a
              frontend developer. I mainly work on projects using React and
              Next.js, striving to create efficient and interactive websites and
              applications. I have build a blog using React and a portfolio site
              using Next, so feel free to stop by and take a look!

          My blog is built with React, TypeScript, MySQL, NodeJS, Express,
          PostCSS, TailwindCSS!
          <br />
          The reason I created a blog is to document my development projects and
          to keep track of how much I've grown.
          <br />
          Additionally, I believe that as a developer, one should be create at
          least personal blog, so I decided to make one.
          <br />I hope those of you who are reading this blog can gain knowledge
          from my articles as well. I welcome sharing knowledge through
          comments.ðŸ˜€
